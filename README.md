# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

This project analyzes a diabetes dataset and applies several classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict diabetes outcomes. It includes EDA, feature importance, model comparison using cross-validation, and accuracy reporting.

# Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data preprocessing and visualization
Model training and evaluation
Cross-validation comparison of 5 classifiers
Feature importance visualization

# Models Used
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier

# Results
The best performing model SVM is selected based on 5-fold cross-validation accuracy.

# Usage
pip install -r requirements.txt
python diabetes_prediction.py
